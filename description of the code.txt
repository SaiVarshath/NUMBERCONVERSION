ABOUT THE PROJECT:

This C program is a versatile number system conversion tool, 
designed to handle conversions between decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal formats. 
It features a menu-driven interface, allowing users to perform six different conversions: 

1. Decimal to Binary
2. Binary to Decimal
3. Decimal to Octal
4.  Octal to Decimal
5. Hexadecimal to Binary
6. Binary to Hexadecimal

 The program employs dynamic memory allocation, bitwise operations, and string manipulations to ensure accurate and efficient conversions. It includes error-checking mechanisms and custom utilities like string reversal. This project is ideal for understanding number systems, memory management, and bit-level operations, making it a valuable learning resource in C programming.
